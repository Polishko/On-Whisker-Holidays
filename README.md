You can also filter based on search criteria (such as wi-fi, beach, nature, city etc) by entering keywords in the search bar. For more detailed information on each hotel, including an image, rating (to be added), short description, facilities (i.e pool, wi-fy, parking), current local temperature, and web-page address click on each hotel in the list.
